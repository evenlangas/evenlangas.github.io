                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a novel method of simulating human trajectories using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process in addition to deep learning (DL) based classification.
                  <span id="abstract-full-1" class="abstract-full">
                      The OU process is a stochastic process and is used in this paper to simulate the movement of a person on a typical factory floor. This work aims at developing systems that increase machines' awareness of people and make predictions about their behaviour to improve efficiency and safety in industrial settings. Sequences of simulated 2D coordinates of people moving on the factory floor are generated. Successively, these synthetic data are used to classify the path that the human is following, using a stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) network and a stacked bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network. The results from this study suggest that, for such applications, it should be possible to predict future movements in 2D for human-robot collaboration (HRC) and teaming (HRT).

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> The successful realisation of Industry 5.0 relies on seamless collaboration between humans and robots in shared workspaces.
                  <span id="abstract-full-2" class="abstract-full">
                      This paper investigates human trajectory prediction (HTP) in a factory setting to enhance safety, productivity, and adaptability in human-machine environments. Using a state-of-the-art light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system with reflective mirrors to extend the field of view, motion data are collected across a 26 m × 20 m indoor industrial floor. Human trajectories are classified to predict workstation transitions using a stacked long-short term memory (LSTM) network. To address the challenges of limited real-world data, transfer learning is applied by first training the model on synthetically generated trajectories. The paper compares a traditional stochastic method, specifically the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, with a modern learning based method, represented by a timeseries generative adversarial network (TimeGAN). Further on, the algorithm is fine-tuned on the real-world dataset. The comparison show that in data-scarce scenarios, OU outperforms TimeGAN in most metrics. The LSTM model trained on OU-based data and real-world data shows an overall accuracy gain of 4.8 percentage points compared to training on real-world data only. It is able to predict the goal workstation three seconds in advance with an accuracy of 95.6%, demonstrating the potential for predictive models to improve workplace operations by reducing stall time, optimising workstation readiness, and reducing the need for traditional safety cages.

                  <span id="abstract-full-3" class="abstract-full">
                      This paper presents a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2seq) model designed for human trajectory prediction (HTP) on a factory floor, serving as a critical component for future robot navigation systems. By accurately forecasting human movements using real-world trajectory data, our approach lays the groundwork for mobile robots to efficiently navigate complex environments without interfering with or disturbing human activities. The model leverages advanced techniques including normalisation, positional encoding, and multi-head attention within transformer blocks—to capture both short- and long-term dependencies in human motion. Evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and the coefficient of determination (R²) demonstrates significant improvements over traditional recurrent models. While this work focuses on the predictive model, its implications extend to the development of intelligent robotic systems that enhance operational safety and productivity through improved human–robot interaction.
