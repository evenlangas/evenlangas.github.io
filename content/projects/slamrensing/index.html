                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Slamrensing AS operates over 50 water treatment plants at construction sites across Norway. They faced several challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Non-intuitive interfaces made it difficult for operators to understand and interpret system errors</li>
                    <li>Technicians had to be dispatched to physical plants to diagnose issues, causing delays and inefficiencies</li>
                    <li>Limited real-time monitoring capabilities</li>
                    <li>Inefficient resource allocation and maintenance scheduling</li>
                </ul>

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> A digital twin (DT) is a digital representation of a physical asset that serves as its counterpart — or twin.
                        <span id="abstract-full-8" class="abstract-full">
                            DTs differ from static, three-dimensional models in that they are continuously updated with data from numerous sources. In one continually changing world of pervasive computing, where computational and human intelligence are expanding everywhere, DTs can be regarded as the backbone for addressing the synergy of software, devices, movable objects, networks, and people. In this paper, we present a novel perspective for designing, prototyping and testing pervasive and connected DTs for edge computing enabled industrial applications. The provided paradigm allows for the creation of computational models for cloud computing as well as the transmission of data and computational intelligence through analytic platforms. A case study is presented to demonstrate the possibilities of the suggested framework. According to the outlined findings, the proposed architecture contributes to effective maintenance and management of infrastructures and facilities.
